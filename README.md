# Rydberg-platform-evolution
Building up the Hamitonian of a Rydberg platform, and calculate its time evolution. Various numerical techniques may be used.

The motivation for this project comes from several papers by the Lukin group at Harvard University on the Rydberg atom platform. Here is some relevant references:

According to the paper, researchers chosed to use **adiabatic evolution** to prepare the checkerboard phase. They use laser to act with Rydberg atoms and keep the Rabi frequncy &Omega to be a constant. Then, gradually modulate the detuning &Delta
